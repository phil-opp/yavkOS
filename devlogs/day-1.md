# Day one!
I started off following the first 2 blog posts of blog os, and got a simple VGA hello world working, and got this working
![hello world](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1084299124427468811/1084613705397964861/image.png?width=748&height=308)

I could now run a `print` or `println` macro, which allowed me to easily print to the VGA text buffer

After I got home from a walk, I then started work on the third post of `blog os`, which
was implementing testing, along with testing it also got me to add printing to serial,
with the `serial_print` and `serial_println` macros, these allow me to easily debug,
without needing to display on the host system

I can't stress enough how helpfull blog os has been, most of my code comes from there, but wont be for long :) (I hope)

I also added a nice message, and then I ended the day.
